**Vehicle Detection**

Self-driving car needs to detect other vehicles on the road to safely drive. The goal of this project is to detect other vehicles on the road using images from the roof top-mounted camera on self driving car.


The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

List of files in Repository:
1. ***P5_VehicleDetectionAndTracking.ipynb*** is the python notebook containing all the implementation of the project.
2. ***writeup_report.md*** is the markdown for summarizing the methodology and results
3. Other Folders and files contains resources are either the input/output images/videos for implementation or the resources for the writeup.
